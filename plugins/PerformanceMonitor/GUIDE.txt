= INSTALLATION = 
To install Performance Monitor you must run a bukkit server and it's recommended to use the intended game
version. You must locate your servers "plugins" directory where you'll have to place the JAR file
contained by the ZIP archive in which you found this guide. If you prefer to change configurations before
starting the plugin you may do so by moving the "PerformanceMonitor" folder from the ZIP archive to your servers
"plugins" directory. You then have to edit the "config.yml" file to change the configuration.


= CHANGING CONFIGURATION =
You can change configuration settings at any time by editing the "config.yml" file located in
the "PerformanceMonitor" folder inside your servers "plugin" directory. After you edited the file
you must have the plugin to reload the configuration, you can do this by:

- Restarting the server
- Execute the "serverstate" command
- Execute the "/ss reload" command


= COMMANDS =
/serverstate - Show the server stats
/serverstate time - Show only the time stats
/serverstate memory - Show only the memory stats
/serverstate disk - Show only the disk stats
/serverstate backup - Show only the backup stats
/serverstate world - Show only the world stats
/serverstate player - Show only the player stats

Note that the "/ss" command can be used instead of "/serverstate" for faster access!

= Plugin version verification =
Every time you start your server the plugin will attempt to see if there is any new versions available for
download. If the attempt is unsuccessful the plugin will skip the version verification. This will not affect
your servers performance or how fast the plugin loads in any noticeable way. This feature can be turned off in
the configuration but it's recommended to leave it on.

= Privacy =
This plugin keep track on the amount of users and which version of the plugin that is the most popular. I respect
everyone's privacy and I guarantee not even your server IP is picked up.


= MESSAGE FROM THE DEVELOPER =
Thank you for downloading my Performance Monitor plugin! It was never intended to make this
plugin available to the public, just a simple solution for my own server issues. Even though I have
been inactive from time to time the amount of servers using my plugin has just kept getting more
and more. I am very thankful for you using my plugin, it keeps my motivation high!
