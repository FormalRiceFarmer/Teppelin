# First of all, make sure those pesky SVN folders don't end up on git
.svn

# Next, ignore all untracked files...
#/*

# ...except the following folders and files in them
#!/data
#!/lua
#!/materials
#!/models
#!/settings
#!/sound

# If you need more folders at the root level, don't hesitate to add them
# If you need a new file at the root level, just use "git add -f <filename>"
